# LemonAid

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Structure

The main functionality of the app is open to all users. This represents the first two pages of the application--ingredients
and Recipes--which are public routes. 

The sole private route is the Saved Recipes page. This application uses JWT Authentication Tokens associated with proper username and login and stored in sessionStorage, which allow access to the saved recipes page, which itself is associated with a specific user.

### Three Main Pages

### IngredientsPage

Users can add ingredients at the bottom of the page and launch a search for recipes.

### RecipesPage

Users are greeted with a rendered list of ingredients based on the Ingredients entered in the IngredientsPage. Data is carried over via context--and so is lost upon refresh. 

### Saved Recipes 

Recipes that have been saved by users for later use.

## Testing 

This application was built with testing from enzyme.

### Installing

Clone this repo:

Initialize a new empty git repo:
rm -rf .git && git init

Install nodes:
Run npm install inside directory


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
